# S3RGI09

Welcome to my personal page! I'm **S3RGI09**, a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for programming. Here you'll find information about my work and projects, as well as some useful scripts I've developed in Python.

## About Me

I am a software developer with experience in cybersecurity. I enjoy exploring new technologies and learning how to protect systems against threats. My areas of interest include security analysis, automated scripting, and creating useful tools to enhance cybersecurity. 
I can program in multiple languages, but the one I use the most is Python. 
I speak Spanish and English.

## Personal Projects

Programming is a fundamental part of my daily life. I adopt a free and community software philosophy, so all my scripts are available to the community on a voluntary basis.

```python
print("Free software is a gift to humanity. â€” R. St. Amant.")
```
## Contributions to free software

I have actively contributed to a multitude of free software projects as a developer, some of them being **FreeBSD**, **Zap Proxy**, **Kali**, **Debian**, **Blender**, **LibreOffice**, **Apache2**, **Nmap**, **Tor project**, **Aircrack-ng** and many more, sometimes in the code itself, other times improving the website and other times improving the documentation.

Contributing to free software is a hobby for me and contributing to security and improving society in general.
