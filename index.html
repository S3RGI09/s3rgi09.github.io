                    <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>My passion for computing goes back a long way, <strong>when I was 10 years old</strong>, I was sitting in front of the computer that my family and I had, I started watching YouTube and a video of "How to be a hacker" came up, there they talked about <code>Python</code>, <code>Linux</code>, installing an OS on a USB, <code>Nmap</code>, <code>Networking</code>, and in general a very simple introduction to computing, that's when my curiosity was piqued and the first step was to install Linux on a USB, things went badly, because as I didn't know that Linux was a Kernel, I installed the <code>.tar.xz</code> file of the Kernel on a USB. I also remember a website called <code>hackear.me</code> which simulated hacking a person's social networks, and in which I felt powerful for "doing things" that for others were impossible. Although no, it didn't do anything at all, in fact I suspect it was a way to gather phone and email information to send spam. But I believed it and had a good time.
                    <p> </p>
                    <p><strong>2 years later</strong>, I could exploit vulnerabilities from Kali to Active Directory systems, troubleshoot HackTheBox machines and program my own scripts in Python, Bash and even program scripts in Lua for Nmap. All this thanks to YouTube channels like <code>s4vitar</code>, which marked my path to develop as a cybersecurity analyst.</p>
